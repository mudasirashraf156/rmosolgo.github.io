Pat Shaughnessy's ["Using a Ruby Class to Write Functional Code"](http://patshaughnessy.net/2014/4/8/using-a-ruby-class-to-write-functional-code) gives an example of bringing functional programming principles into object-oriented design. I like it.

<!-- more -->

It Pat's example, he turns a group of pure functions into a class whose state is _immutable-ish_ (they technically could be changed, but they aren't) & whose methods are _pure-ish_ (they read from internal state, too). He says:

> You’ve broken the rules and rewritten your pure, functional program in a more idiomatic, Ruby manner. However, you haven’t lost the spirit of functional programming. Your code is just as easy to understand, maintain and test.

[One commenter](http://patshaughnessy.net/2014/4/8/using-a-ruby-class-to-write-functional-code#comment-1331596525) goes further:

> I think you do not break the rules of FP by relying on `@line` and `@values`. `@line` is just partially applying a parameter to the "functions" of Line and currification is a usual techique in FP. `@values` is memoizing the result of a function which also comes from FP.

There were a few ideas that jumped out at me.

## "No Side-effects" = Clarity at the Call Site

Functions that don't modify their arguments are often easier to use. Their usage _reveals intent_.

Which do you prefer:

```ruby
def exclaim_1(statement)
  # modify the argument
  statement << "!!!"
  return nil
end

wow = "Wow"
exclaim_1(wow)  # => nil
wow             # => "Wow!!!"
```

or:

```ruby
def exclaim_2(statement)
  # make a new string
  return statement + "!!!"
end

wow = "Wow"
such_wow = exclaim_2(wow) # => "Wow!!!"
wow                       # => "Wow"
such_wow                  # => "Wow!!!"
```

In the first case, if you didn't have the output in front of you, you wouldn't know what `exclaim_1` did. You'd have to find the file and read the method body to know its purpose.

In the second case, it's obvious at the call site that the function returns a new, significant value. (Otherwise, why would the developer have captured in a new variable?)

## Think of `self` as an Argument

You can extend the benefit of call site clarity to an object's internal state, too.

The commenter mentions that "`@line` is like a parameter" to the class's methods. Although it _isn't_ part of the method signature, it has some parameter-like properties. It is:

- A value which affects the output
- Unchanged by the function

What if you _always_ treated `self` like that? I mean, you didn't modify it inside method bodies, you treated it as read-only (as often as possible).

Python really invites you to think of `self` as a parameter of the function. It's actually part of the method signature:

```python
class Something():
  def some_method(self, arg_1, arg2):
    self # => the instance
    return "whatever"
```

In fact, PyCharm will even complain if you modify `self` during a method:

(In reality, `self` _is_ an argument in any language runtime that I ever heard of ... we just tend not to think of it that way!)

## What Gives?

I spend most of my time _maintaining_ software and FP pays off big time in that regard:

- __Tests are more reliable__ for pure functions: if the function yields the correct output with those inputs today, it will _always_ yield the correct output with those inputs.
- Pure functions are __easy to understand__: the only factors are the inputs and there's no muddling from outside universe. Knowledge of the function body is sufficent to understand the function.
- Pure functions must be __decoupled__. The only touch the world via _inputs_ and _outputs_ so they can't depend on anything else.
