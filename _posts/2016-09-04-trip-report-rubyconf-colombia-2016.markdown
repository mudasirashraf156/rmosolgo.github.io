I just got back from [RubyConf Colombia](http://rubyconf.co). The content was great, the community was great, and the venue was great!

## The Content

This was a single-track conference, but there were no dud talks! I prefer code-driven talks, and for that reason, these were a few of my favorites:

- [David Pelaez](https://twitter.com/davidpelaez) demoed some functional concepts in Ruby, including `Right` and `Left` (?? name) and `None` objects.
- [Oscar Rendon](https://twitter.com/orendon) described an approach to combining business rules which allows you to simplify conditional branching and reuse code more effectively.
- [Nick Sutterer](https://twitter.com/apotonick) shared some insights into busting up "god objects" into more specialized, context-specific units of code.
- [Sebastian Arcila-Valensuela](https://twitter.com/sarcilav) and [Frederico Builes](https://twitter.com/febuiles) gave my favorite non-code talk. They told a funny story of making tradeoffs while working on a tough problem: building a human-friendly path from a disjoint set of points.

I presented ["Data Fetching with GraphQL and ActionCable"](/talks) while I was there, and I was happy with how it went.

## The Community

My favorite part of this event was getting to know the local Ruby community. In fact, I should say "software development community", as many attendees were not full-time Ruby developers.

Many things were familiar to me: these folks are building interesting projects (like [Wesura](https://www.wesura.com/), peer-to-peer insurance, and [Vlip](https://vlip.co/), a mobile payment platform). They're excited about doing great work and learning new things. Also, there's a big focus on training and education: many attendees were students at local universities or participants in web dev bootcamps.

Other things were different. I saw many more female attendees at this conference than others. I know that this was a goal for the organizers, bravo to them for succeeding! Also, the community is relatively new. RubyConf Colombia is the only Ruby conference in Spanish-speaking Latin America (the other is in Brazil), and it requires __a lot__ of work to plan and execute, because there isn't so much momentum in place. For example, there's not a culture of companies sending their employees to conferences, so many attendees paid out of pocket.

I also realized something I take for granted: as a native English speaker, basically _all_ technical information is available in my mother tongue, no matter where in the world it came from. What a blessing! It makes me think how valuable the translation service must have been for some native Spanish speakers. Of course, it was hugely valuable to me too -- I would have been lost without it during the Spanish-language talks!

## The Venue

[El Teatrico](http://www.elteatrico.co/) was a great spot for this event. We were close to max capacity, and that gave the conference a very intimate feeling. During breaks, you couldn't help but start a conversation with your neighbor.

Besides that, the translation was _amazing_! There were two guys taking turns, and they did a great job keeping up with the talks and translating technical vocabulary. I felt like I understood almost 100% of the Spanish-language talks.

I really enjoyed Medellin, too. It checked all the boxes for me: great environment, great people and great food!

## In Summary

This was a wonderful trip! I loved making some new friends and visiting this fantastic city. I really appreciate the work of the organizers, and that their primary goal is really to benefit their community. I'm excited to see what next year holds for them!
