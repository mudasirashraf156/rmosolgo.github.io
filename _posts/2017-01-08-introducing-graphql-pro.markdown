`graphql-ruby` is almost two years old! Today, I'm adding a new element to the project, [`GraphQL::Pro`](http://graphql.pro).

<!-- more -->

I have three goals with `GraphQL::Pro`:

1. Provide robust, easy-to-use integrations with third-party tools
2. Open a formal feedback loop with teams using GraphQL
3. Prevent open-source burnout

Additionally, I'm starting a [GraphQL Ruby newsletter](http://tinyletter.com/graphql-ruby).

## Integrations

Today, `GraphQL::Pro` provides some integrations with third-party tools:

- [Authorization plugins](http://rmosolgo.github.io/graphql-ruby/pro/authorization) for Pundit and CanCan (or custom auth)
- Improved [connections for ActiveRecord](http://rmosolgo.github.io/graphql-ruby/pro/cursors)
- [Instrumentation for app monitoring](http://rmosolgo.github.io/graphql-ruby/pro/monitoring) platforms (New Relic, Scout and Skylight).

As time goes on, I'll keep an eye out for other integrations that could be included in `GraphQL::Pro`. (If you have a suggestion, I'd love to hear it!)

## Feedback Loop

Some teams adopt GraphQL as a foundational element of their application. I'd like to provide them service (and peace of mind) as they build on that investment. `GraphQL::Pro` customers have my ear for any performance issues, bugs or feature requests. They also have an assurance that I'll continue to maintain and improve `graphql-ruby`.

## Prevent Burnout

I really enjoy working on `graphql-ruby` and I'm excited about the work to be done in 2017. But it's no secret that open-source work can become an unrewarding, thankless grind. Charging money for `GraphQL::Pro` provides me with a simple, concrete "reward" to continue the work. I hope this will be good for me, for the project, and for others who are invested in the project.

## Buying GraphQL::Pro

If any of this sounds good to you, you can buy `GraphQL::Pro` at http://graphql.pro !
