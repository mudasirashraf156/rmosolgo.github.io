## Driving to Gila Bend, AZ

From Marfa, TX to Carlsbad, CA, was too long for a single day of driving, so we broke it up. The landscape can best be characterized by conversations like this one:

  - "Whoa, look at those big, dry mountains way out there!"

  - _1 hour passes..._
  - "Whoa, are those mountains just ahead of us those same ones?" "Yep!"


<p><img src="/assets/images/roadtrip_mountains_2.jpg" width="300" height="300" /></p>


  - _30 minutes pass..._
  - "Whoa, are we driving through those same mountains that we saw so far in the distance?" "Yeah, I think so!"

  - _30 minutes pass..._
  - "Whoa, look at those big, dry mountains way out there!"

  - _You can guess where this is going!_


Actually, there were several of such basins which were very interesting:

Somewhere in west Texas, we saw this strange blimp:

Turns out, it's an [unmanned craft that looks for drug planes](http://www.krgv.com/news/west-texas-based-air-force-radar-blimp-crashes).


Anyways, lots of Texas, followed by a little New Mexico,

and then a little Arizona.

Interestingly, we found NM and AZ to be much greener than TX -- lots of irrigated fields. Night fell in Arizona:

We didn't have a hotel reservation, but Valerie found a great spot along the way:

The **Space Age Lodge**. It's a Best Western whose first owners were supporters of NASA in its early days. The motel is decorated accordingly, with lots of space-y photos and art.

## Carlsbad, CA

We woke up early -- we were both eager to get to our new home. Along the way, we learned that there are mountains in southeastern CA:

<p><img src="/assets/images/roadtrip_california_mountains_4.jpg" width="500" height="500" /></p>

We were tired when we got here. Luckily, our belongings arrived the next day -- we were rested up and excited to move in. We worked quickly -- here are a few pictures of the new place during the process:

## Planning Center Online

I've started work at [Planning Center Online](http://get.planningcenteronline.com). I arrived at an interesting time: It's "_free week_." All staff members have a week to invest a company project that interests them specifically. Except for occasional urgent fixes, the team is working on a handful of new features, new product ideas or other PCO-related side projects.

I love working here. Here are a few reasons why:

  - It's just like [the video](http://get.planningcenteronline.com/careers/).
  - All the teams usually take lunch together. I've had a lot of great opportunities to meet the other guys. It's a lot of fun and a satisfying break from the computer screen.
  - The work environment is loaded with creative energy. A great example is `PiCO`, the _chat bot_: As with many development teams, ours has a chatroom where the team members are encouraged to socialize and collaborate on their work. Our chat room has an automated participant (a bot) named "`PiCO`" who moderates the discussion in several ways:
    - He's hooked up to the office coffee maker and announces `"FRESH POT!"` when the coffee is ready.
    - The front door is usually locked, but if a visitor needs to be let in, the door can be unlocked via chat room ("`pico open door`").
    - `PiCO` adds flavor to conversation. For example, today was someone's anniversary, so someone said `pico gif me happy anniversary` and `PiCO` returned this image:
    <br>
     <p><img src="/assets/images/roadtrip_california_ha.gif" width="300" height="300" /></p>
     <br>
    Awesome!
    - Oh, yeah, and `PiCO` is hooked up to the web servers and bug trackers, so he can issue reminders and announcements about those :)


(By the way, `PiCO` is a customized [Hubot](http://hubot.github.com/))
