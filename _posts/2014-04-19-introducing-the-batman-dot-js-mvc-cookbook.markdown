The ["Batman.js MVC Cookbook"](https://www.softcover.io/read/b5c051f3/batmanjs_mvc_cookbook) is a collection of annotated code snippets for getting things done with [batman.js](http://batmanjs.org).

When I heard that Michael Hartl (of [Rails Tutorial](http://railstutorial.com) fame) was releasing a web publishing platform, I was itching to try it out. I thought a glorified FAQ would be a great way to get the feel for it, and the result is now online as the ["Batman.js MVC Cookbook"](https://www.softcover.io/read/b5c051f3/batmanjs_mvc_cookbook).

The "book" is really just a collection of common patterns and best practices in batman.js applications, taken from my own experience. I hope that others will contribute by adding "recipes" or requesting new ones, so I put the book's [source code on Github](https://github.com/rmosolgo/batmanjs-mvc-cookbook).

It's not quite a batman.js tutorial, although I'm really enjoying Softcover, so maybe I'll get one up there soon. It would be a good opportunity to take the [batman.js Firebase bindings](https://github.com/rmosolgo/batfire) for a spin, too!
